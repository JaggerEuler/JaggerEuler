I am a WGU undergraduate with an interest in cybersecurity and information assurance.


## Objective


Cybersecurity is a field that was introduced to me by my father and friends around 2022. I did my self-study of the basics to see what dcybersecurity was about and my interest was piqued. As I have learned many things during my time at WGU, I have realized that being on the blue team side of things is where I want to be, and I am now eager to transition into that field.
